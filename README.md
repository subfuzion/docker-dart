# docker-dart

This sample is based on the original work to create a slim Docker image here:
[subfuzion/dart-docker-slim](https://github.com/subfuzion/dart-docker-slim).

The effort ultimately led to the creation of the
[official Docker image for Dart](https://hub.docker.com/_/dart),
now maintained by the Dart team at this repo:
[dart-lang/dart-docker](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-docker).
This repo is now archived.

Thanks to everyone who contributed or provided feedback,
particularly @tianon, @mit-mit, and @athomas.
